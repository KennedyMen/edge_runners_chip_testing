The best way to start is to clone the testing github repository and place it in your home directory 


`git clone https://github.com/KennedyMen/edge_runners_chip_testing.git`

type this command into your terminal and make sure you are cd'd into your home directory 

once this is done you'll have this folder structure
```
    Home
    ├── example-directory/
    │   ├── build/
    │   ├── scripts/
    │   ├── src/
    │   │   ├── backend/
    │   │   │   └── server/
    │   │   └── frontend/
    │   │       ├── js/
    │   │       └── styles/
    │   └── tests/
```
